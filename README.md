Kagayaki for Neovim
===

Kagayaki is a gorgeously soft colorscheme for Neovim, created with the intention to be the spiritual successor of [hazakura-emacs](https://git.devraza.duckdns.org/devraza/hazakura-emacs) (and it's respective colorscheme).
I aim for the color palette used to make this theme to be the last I ever make - it'll be continuously updated whenever I deem changes being made necessary.

Here's a screenshot of it in action, as seen in [radiant.nvim](https://git.devraza.duckdns.org/devraza/radiant.nvim):
