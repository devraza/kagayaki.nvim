Kagayaki for Neovim
===

Kagayaki is a gorgeously soft colorscheme for Neovim, created with the intention to be the spiritual successor of [kagayaki-emacs](https://git.devraza.duckdns.org/devraza/kagayaki-emacs).
I aim for the color palette used to make this theme to be the last I ever make - it'll be continuously updated whenever I deem changes being made necessary - please not that this differs from [kagayaki-emacs](https://git.devraza.duckdns.org/devraza/kagayaki-emacs)' slightly, despite the naming.

Here's a screenshot of it in action, as seen in [radiant.nvim](https://git.devraza.duckdns.org/devraza/radiant.nvim):
